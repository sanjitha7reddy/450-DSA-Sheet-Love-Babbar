Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy=prices[0];
        int profit=0;
        for(int i=1;i<prices.size();i++){
            if(prices[i]<buy){
                buy=prices[i];
            }
            else if(prices[i]-buy>profit){
                profit=prices[i]-buy;
            }
        }
        return profit;
        
    }
};
