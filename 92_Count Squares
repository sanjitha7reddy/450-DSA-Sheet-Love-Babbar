Given a positive integer n, find the number of perfect squares that are less than n in the sample space of perfect squares. The sample space consists of all perfect squares starting from 1 (i.e., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, â€¦)

Examples :

Input: n = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares less than 9. So, the Output is 2.

class Solution {
  public:
    int countSquares(int n) {
        // code here
        //return floor(sqrt(n - 1));
        int count=0;
        int i=1;
        while(i*i<n){
            count++;
            i++;
            
        }
        return count;
    }
};

Time Complexity: sqrt(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
